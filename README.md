 Project Motivation:
 In this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow 2019 data to better understand:
1. What are 2019 general trends in number of programmers across the world?
2. What is the salary difference in Women VS Men in US and Other countries?
3. How is the Career and Job satisfication of the programmers in US vs Other countries?

File Descriptions:
Analysis.ipynb: The notebook to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
survey_results_public.csv - Downloaded 2019 data from URL:https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

Results:
1. In 2019, United States has max number of programmers. Women programmers ratio to men is around 1: 10.
2. After comparing the salary between the Men and Women in US vs other countries, we found that the salary of US programmer - both Men and women is higher than the programmers from rest of the world until around years of coding experience.
The Women programmers are paid less than the men, even with same work experience.
The difference in salary for men in US vs other countries is higher than women.
3. We found that the Career and Job Satisfaction of Women programmers in US is higher than those of the rest of the world.
4. When comparing how often programmers work remotely, it looks like men in US work more remotely than rest of the world.
Women programmers tend to work remotely more after 20 year of work experience in US and rest of the world and this is probably the reason for more Career and job satisfaction.
